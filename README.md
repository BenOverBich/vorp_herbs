# vorp herbs

### Requirements

* vorp core
---
A plant picking and spawning system for RedM/Vorp.

It will spawn plants configured places, and allow players to walk up to them and pick them for inventory items.
A cooldown for each spot will be initiated afterward - this can be either configured per node, or on a global level (or both)!
During cooldown the pick prompt will still be visible, but greyed out and unuseable.

Pretty straightforward. Config is documented for your ease.
